Tracking the engagement and actions of your colleagues on candidate referrals is critical to managing a successful employee referral program. This section will guide you through the process of monitoring these activities effectively.

### Monitoring Colleague Engagement
Once you have nudged your colleagues, they will be prompted to engage with the Wintro platform, where they will see a list of matches accepted for vacancies you have enabled for referrals. This view is similar to what you see in the **Candidates** tab, but colleagues can only access specific actions and details about the candidates.

### Actions Colleagues Can Take
Your colleagues can take one of several actions on each suggested match:
- **Refer**: If they know the candidate and believe they are a fit, they can refer them by filling out details on their relationship with the candidate and why they think the candidate is suitable. They will send a personal link to the candidate to apply, which they must confirm they have sent.
- **Recommend**: If they think the candidate might be a fit but don't know them well enough to make a direct referral.
- **Not a Fit**: They can specify why the candidate is not suitable, whether it's just for this vacancy or for all vacancies.
- **Donâ€™t Know**: This option is used if they are connected to the person but do not actually know them.

### Tracking and Notifications
- **Referred Candidates**: Once a link is sent by a colleague, that match is removed from others' lists to prevent multiple referrals for the same candidate. You will receive an email notification, and the candidate will move to the **Referred** stage in the **Candidates** tab. You will also see comments from the colleague about their connection to the candidate and why they are a good fit.
- **Recommended Candidates**: Similarly, when a candidate is recommended, you will receive a notification, and the candidate moves to the **Recommended** stage, where you can view the colleague's comments on why they think the candidate might be a fit.
- **Not a Fit**: Candidates deemed not a fit will appear in the **Not a Fit** stage, along with reasons provided by your colleagues.

### Now let's get some referrals!
This system now allows you to see each candidate as a task that your colleagues can address, providing clarity and ensuring that all potential referrals are evaluated. It also facilitates a structured follow-up on all actions taken, ensuring that no candidate referral is missed.
