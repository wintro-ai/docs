In the Review Candidates section, you will learn how to assess the suitability of candidates matched to your vacancies using Wintro's AI-driven insights.

### Reviewing Matched Candidates
To begin, navigate to the **Candidates** tab and select the relevant vacancy from the drop-down menu in the upper left corner. You will see a list of candidates ranked by their compatibility with the vacancy. Each candidate entry includes their score, main inferred characteristics that match the vacancy requirements, the colleagues connected to the candidate, available actions, and a stats button that displays all activity related to that candidate.

### Detailed Candidate Evaluation
Click on a candidate to view detailed information, such as their overall score, positive and negative traits, reasons behind the score, inferred years of relevant experience, language skills, and their work and education history. This comprehensive view helps you make an informed decision about each candidate's fit.

### Accepting or Rejecting Candidates
Based on your assessment, you can accept a candidate by clicking the **Accept** button under Actions. If the candidate does not meet your criteria, click **Reject**. If you change your mind or make an error, you can easily undo your decision by navigating to the "Accepted" or "Rejected" sections from the vacancy selector and selecting the undo action for a specific candidate.

### Providing Feedback
When rejecting a candidate, you have the option to specify why they were not suitable, whether it's related to this specific vacancy or all vacancies at your company. This feedback is valuable for refining future candidate searches.

### Moving Forward with Accepted Candidates
After accepting candidates, go to the Accepted stage where you can prompt your colleagues to refer the approved candidates. This step is crucial for leveraging the power of your team's network and ensuring a quality referral process.
