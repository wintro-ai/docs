Welcome to Wintro! This guide will help you get started with our AI-powered employee referral platform, making your referral hiring process more efficient, cost-effective, and higher in quality.

Follow these steps to get your first referral hire:

* **Connect your Systems**: To begin, seamlessly integrate Wintro with your existing HR systems and tools. This ensures a smooth flow of referral data and streamlines your recruitment process from day one.

* **Invite your Colleagues**: Get your team on board by inviting your colleagues to join Wintro. Collaboration is key to harnessing the full potential of employee referrals, so encourage everyone to participate.

* **Find Candidates**: Leverage Wintro's powerful AI to source high-quality candidates from your employees' networks. Our platform helps you identify the best referrals efficiently.

* **Review Candidates**: Evaluate the candidates suggested by our AI with ease. Wintro provides a score and reasoning to review and assess the suitability of each candidate, making it easier to proceed with the best matches.

* **Nudge your Colleagues**: Sometimes a gentle reminder is all it takes. Use Wintro to nudge your colleagues straight from your Slack, Teams, Google Chat or email and encourage them to make referrals and recommendations.

* **Track Suggestions**: Keep track of all your colleagues' reviewed candidates in one place. Wintro allows you to monitor the status of each candidate, ensuring no potential hire slips through the cracks. On top of our own tracking, we also push referred candidates who have applied straight back into your ATS, so you can continue the hiring process from there.
