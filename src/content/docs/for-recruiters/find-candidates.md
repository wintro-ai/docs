Optimizing your vacancies to harness the full potential of Wintro's AI-driven candidate matching is a key step in efficiently sourcing high-quality referrals from your colleagues' networks.

### Syncing and Adding Vacancies
Begin by navigating to the **Vacancies** tab. If your vacancies haven't been synced from your ATS yet, click on **Sync ATS** to import them. If you haven't connected your ATS, please refer to the [Connect your Systems](/for-recruiters/connect-your-systems) section of our documentation. Alternatively, if you don't use an ATS or choose not to connect one, you can manually add vacancies by clicking the **Add Vacancy** button in the top right corner.

### Fine-Tuning Vacancy Details
When you click on a vacancy, you'll see the data we've synced from your ATS or that you've added manually. It's crucial to adjust this data to better target the candidates you're actually seeking, as the public job description may not fully reflect the ideal candidate profile. These changes remain private within Wintro.

### Generating Candidate Matches
Proceed to the **Generate** tab to start generating potential matches. Here, you can fine-tune the matching process:
- **Exclude recruiter networks**: Useful if you prefer not to have recruiters referring candidates.
- **Exclude ex-employees**: Apply if your referral policy excludes former employees.
- **Include select companies**: Target candidates from specific companies if desired.
- **Exclude select companies**: Avoid candidates from partner or customer companies.
- **Include locations with radii**: Narrow your search to specific geographical areas.

### Preview and Finalize Candidates
After setting your filters, preview the candidates to assess the initial match quality. If the candidates shown don't seem suitable, adjust the vacancy detailsâ€”add skills, experience requirements, or related roles to refine your search. Once satisfied, apply AI filters like years of relevant experience and preferred languages to enhance the accuracy of matches.

### Reviewing Matches
Generating matches shouldn't take more than two minutes. Once completed, you'll receive a notification and can view the matched candidates under the **Candidates** tab. Here, you can review them in detail and proceed with the recruitment process.
