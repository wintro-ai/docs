description: Learn how to fine-tune your vacancies and use Wintro's AI to discover the best matching candidates.
---


Wintro automates the candidate discovery process by analyzing your vacancies and matching them with potential candidates from your colleagues' professional networks. The platform uses AI to evaluate candidates based on your specific requirements and scoring criteria, ensuring you receive high-quality referrals that align with your hiring needs.
This page will walk you through the vacancy setup process, from initial configuration to opening your position for referrals. You'll learn how to:

- Review and adjust vacancy details
- Configure search filters
- Fine-tune scoring criteria
- Preview potential matches
- Open your vacancy for referrals

### Syncing and Adding Vacancies
Wintro automatically syncs with your ATS every 3 hours to import new vacancies. If you're not using an ATS, you can manually add positions through the **Add Vacancy** button in the Vacancies tab. Each new vacancy, whether synced or manually added, will appear in your Vacancies tab ready for setup and optimization. If you haven't connected your ATS, please refer to the [Connect your Systems](/for-recruiters/connect-your-systems) section of our documentation. 

### Vacancy Setup Process
When you click on a new vacancy, you'll find a four-step setup process that helps optimize your search for the ideal candidates:

1. Review and adjust vacancy details
2. Configure search filters
3. Fine-tune scoring criteria
4. Preview potential matches
5. Open vacancy for referrals

#### Step 1: Review and adjust vacancy details
When a vacancy is added, the initial details come from your ATS or manual input. In this first section, you'll see:

* **Title**: The role name as it appears in your ATS
* **Location**: Where the position is based
* **Employment Type**: Full-time, part-time, or contract
* **Policy Type**: Remote, hybrid, or in-office
* **Content**: The full job description
* **Public URL**: Link to the public job posting
* **Bounty**: Referral bonus amount, if applicable

Review these details carefully as they form the foundation for Wintro's AI matching. You can modify any field to better reflect your actual requirements without affecting the original ATS listing. These changes only apply within Wintro and help improve candidate matching accuracy.

All subsequent steps—search filters, scoring criteria, and candidate matching—will be based on this information, so ensure it accurately represents your ideal candidate profile.

#### Step 2: Configure search filters
In this section, Wintro automatically generates initial search filters based on your vacancy details. These filters help narrow down potential candidates from your employees' networks.

**Filter Categories:**

* **Target Locations**: 
  * Define geographical search areas with specific radius settings
  * Add multiple locations if needed
  * Adjust radius per location (e.g., 50km from Brussels)

* **Include Filters**: Only candidates matching these criteria will be included in the results
  * Companies: Target candidates from specific organizations known for talent in your field
  * Schools: Filter by educational institutions if specific academic backgrounds are required
  * Role Keywords: Add relevant skills, titles, or industry terms that candidates must have
  * Use these filters sparingly - each added filter reduces the candidate pool

* **Exclude Filters**: Candidates matching these criteria will be removed from results
  * Companies: Remove candidates from certain organizations (e.g., direct competitors)
  * Recruiter Networks: Option to exclude recruiting professionals from results
  * Ex-employees: Filter out former employees if your policy requires
  * Like include filters, use these carefully to avoid over-filtering

**Best Practices:**
1. Keep filters minimal - remember that the goal is to help employees get quality suggestions for referrals
2. It's perfectly acceptable to have some less-relevant candidates in the mix - employees know their network best
3. Use the Preview feature to see 50 potential matches that would result from your current filters
4. Adjust filters if preview results show too many irrelevant candidates
5. Consider removing filters if you're seeing too few candidates

Remember: These filters are just the initial screening step. The scorecard criteria will handle the detailed evaluation of candidates, so you don't need to be too restrictive at this stage. Focus on creating a good foundation for suggestions while keeping enough candidates in the pool for meaningful matching.

#### Step 3: Fine-tune scoring criteria
The scorecard is a crucial component that determines how Wintro's AI evaluates potential candidates. While initially generated from your vacancy details, this scoring system requires thoughtful fine-tuning to ensure you receive the highest quality matches from your employees' networks.

**How the Scorecard Works**

Wintro analyzes your vacancy content and generates relevant criteria categories with corresponding sub-criteria. Each category and sub-criterion can be weighted to reflect its importance in the overall evaluation. The total weights across all categories will be summed up to a total that equals 100%, allowing you to prioritize what matters most for your specific role. You have the flexibility to add, remove, or modify both categories and sub-criteria to match your exact requirements.

**Crafting Effective Criteria**

When developing your scorecard, it's essential to focus on criteria that can be reliably assessed from public LinkedIn profiles. The key is to strike a balance between being specific enough to identify qualified candidates while remaining broad enough to be evaluated from publicly available information.

**Strong Criteria Examples**

*Educational Background*

This category works well because educational details are consistently displayed on LinkedIn profiles. You might include:
- Specific degree levels (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD)
- Fields of study or academic concentrations
- Notable institutions when relevant for your industry

*Professional Experience Progression*

Career trajectory is easily assessed through LinkedIn work history. Effective sub-criteria include:
- Years of experience in relevant roles
- Industry-specific experience
- Progression of responsibilities
- Company types and sizes
- Team leadership experience when publicly stated

*Technical Proficiency*

LinkedIn's skills section and work experience make this category particularly viable:
- Industry-standard tools and platforms
- Programming languages or technical skills
- Professional certifications
- Specific methodologies or frameworks

*Role Transition Logic*

This category evaluates the natural progression toward your open position:
- Current role alignment with your vacancy
- Career movement showing relevant skill development
- Industry transitions that complement your requirements

**Criteria to Avoid**

Certain criteria, while important for hiring decisions, cannot be effectively evaluated from LinkedIn profiles and should be avoided in your scorecard:

*Performance Metrics*
- Specific achievement percentages
- Revenue targets
- Project success rates
- Team performance indicators

*Interpersonal Qualities*
- Cultural fit assessments
- Personality traits
- Communication style
- Leadership approach

*Internal Knowledge*
- Company-specific tool expertise
- Internal process familiarity
- Proprietary system knowledge

**Setting Appropriate Weights**

Weight distribution is crucial for accurate candidate evaluation. Consider:
- Allocating higher weights to must-have qualifications
- Balancing between experience, skills, and education based on role requirements
- Adjusting weights based on preview results
- Starting with larger weights for fundamental requirements and fine-tuning based on candidate preview quality

**Validation and Iteration**

After setting up your initial scorecard:
1. Use the preview feature to evaluate the quality of matches
2. Review how different candidates score across your criteria
3. Adjust weights and criteria based on the preview results
4. Continue iterating until the preview consistently shows relevant candidates
5. Remember that some iteration may be needed once the vacancy is live

The scorecard is your primary tool for ensuring match quality. Take time to refine it, as it directly influences which candidates will be suggested to your employees for referrals. Would you like me to continue with the Preview section?

#### Step 4: Preview and Launch
The preview phase is your opportunity to validate your vacancy setup before opening it for referrals. This crucial step helps ensure that your colleagues will receive high-quality candidate suggestions that align with your hiring needs.

**Preview Process**

When you click "Preview Candidates," Wintro will simulate a search based on your configured filters and scoring criteria. The system will return up to 50 potential candidates, providing you with a representative sample of the matches your colleagues might receive.

During the preview, you'll see how candidates would be evaluated based on your current scorecard settings. This includes their overall job fit score and how they match against your defined criteria. Take time to review these profiles carefully, as they indicate the quality of matches your employees will receive.

**Evaluating Preview Results**

If the preview results don't meet your expectations, you have several options for refinement:

First, review your search filters. Are they too restrictive, potentially excluding qualified candidates? Or too broad, allowing in too many irrelevant profiles? Adjust these filters based on what you observe in the preview results.

Next, examine your scorecard criteria. Look for patterns in the scoring:
- Are candidates scoring too similarly across criteria?
- Are specific criteria consistently producing unexpected results?
- Does the weight distribution accurately reflect your priorities?

Make adjustments as needed and generate new previews until you're satisfied with the quality of matches.

#### Step 5: Open vacancy for referrals

Once you're confident in your setup, click "Start Accepting Referrals" to launch the vacancy. This initiates several automated processes:
1. Wintro performs a comprehensive search across all your employees' networks
2. The system evaluates potential candidates using your finalized criteria
3. Matched candidates are distributed to relevant employees' accounts
4. Employees can begin reviewing and referring candidates

**Important Considerations**
- The vacancy settings will be locked while referrals are open
- A two-minute cooldown period applies between consecutive vacancy openings
- You can close the vacancy at any time if needed
- The employee referral process begins immediately upon opening

Remember that you can always return to previous setup steps if needed, but once you open the vacancy for referrals, your configurations will be locked to ensure consistent candidate evaluation.

### Generating Candidate Matches
Proceed to the **Generate** tab to start generating potential matches. Here, you can fine-tune the matching process:
- **Exclude recruiter networks**: Useful if you prefer not to have recruiters referring candidates.
- **Exclude ex-employees**: Apply if your referral policy excludes former employees.
- **Include select companies**: Target candidates from specific companies if desired.
- **Exclude select companies**: Avoid candidates from partner or customer companies.
- **Include locations with radii**: Narrow your search to specific geographical areas.

### Preview and Finalize Candidates
After setting your filters, preview the candidates to assess the initial match quality. If the candidates shown don't seem suitable, adjust the vacancy details—add skills, experience requirements, or related roles to refine your search. Once satisfied, apply AI filters like years of relevant experience and preferred languages to enhance the accuracy of matches.

### Reviewing Matches
Generating matches shouldn't take more than two minutes. Once completed, you'll receive a notification and can view the matched candidates under the **Candidates** tab. Here, you can review them in detail and proceed with the recruitment process. -->
