### Prerequisites

Before getting started, please **carefully read** the following to make sure you fulfill all requirements for the integration to work:

*   Check whether you are a **"Super Admin"** of your Lever instance.  
    Log into Lever and hover your mouse over the profile icon, **"Super Admin"** should appear under your name.
*   **"Admin"** or other privileges **are not sufficient** to set up the integration.  
    Your user account needs to be a **"Super Admin"**.

*   If you are not a **"Super Admin"** you will not be able to go through the flow and it will fail at the very end:
