### Prerequisites

Before getting started, please **carefully read** the following to make sure you fulfill all requirements for the integration to work:

    1\. Log into your Recruitee instance.  
    2\. Go to your [profile settings](https://app.recruitee.com/#/settings/profile/email_settings) page. You can also find this under **Settings > MY ACCOUNT > Profile**.  
    3\. Make sure that you have the "**Administrator**" role, which you could find it next to your email address:
