### Prerequisites

Identify the **subdomain** of your Carerix application. This is the start of the address you access Carerix on. If you, for example, use Carerix on `my-company.carerix.com`, then your subdomain is `my-company`.

Once you have identified the subdomain, email the Carerix support department ([support@carerix.com](mailto:support@carerix.com)) to ask for an **API token**. Include the subdomain in your email to ensure the support department has the necessary context.

### Instructions

Once youâ€™ve determined the above credentials, the setup is straightforward. Paste the **subdomain** and **API token** into the corresponding fields in the connection flow:
