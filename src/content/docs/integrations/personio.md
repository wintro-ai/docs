### Prerequisites

Before getting started, please **carefully read** the following to make sure you fulfil all requirements for the integration to work:

In order to set up the integration with Personio, you must at least have "access rights" to the following roles:

*   Account configuration > API (to create the API key)
*   Account configuration > Marketplace Integration (to view the credentials of the created API key)

To make sure your account has access to these roles, please follow these steps:

1.  Click on the **Marketplace** button in the sidebar (if you can not see this button, you are missing permissions)

2.  Ensure that you can click on **See connected integrations**![](https://help.kombo.dev/hc/article_attachments/24837808472337)
3.  Ensure that you can click on **Create custom integration** ![](https://help.kombo.dev/hc/article_attachments/24837841575953)

**If you can not follow these steps, you will not be able to set up this integration**. Please ask a system administrator to assign these "access rights" to your account. You can read more about "access rights" [here](https://support.personio.de/hc/en-us/articles/360000038205-Access-rights).

### Find your API domain

Your API domain is the same domain that you use to login to Personio

Open your Personio login page, you should be able to view your domain here.

4.  Personio provides system-generated credentials for ATS APIs, we don’t need to generate new credentials. So, in the “API credentials” page the credentials should already be listed in the bottom as “Recruiting API key”.
