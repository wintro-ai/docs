### Prerequisites

Before getting started, please **carefully read** the following to make sure you fulfill all requirements for the integration to work:

*   You are an admin of your TeamTailor instance or an admin shared their access with you. This is necessary for retrieving the API credentials as explained later in this guide. Verify that you are an admin by following the following steps:

1.  Navigate to the settings page in the top right corner:![](https://help.kombo.dev/hc/article_attachments/17657846165905)  
      
    
2.  If you are able to see the "API Keys" menu, you are an admin and can proceed with the setup. If you can not see the API Keys menu item, then you are not an admin and need to contact your teamtailor administrator to finish the setup process.![](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/77049629276/original/RFVPjXJsW-75k77hw97veM2Udmg9csYy1g.png?1632910374)
