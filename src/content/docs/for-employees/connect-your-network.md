Hey there! Ready to make your professional connections work wonders? Here’s how you can sync your network to Wintro and start getting awesome job referral suggestions.

### Why Connect Your Network?
By connecting your network, you enable our smart AI to scour through your professional contacts and identify potential candidates who could be great fits for openings at your company. It’s all about making your network valuable to your team and snagging some referral bonuses along the way!

### Getting Started with Network Sync
Once your organization adds you to Wintro, you’ll receive an invitation email with a privacy notice. Here’s where you decide how you’d like to manage your network sync:

1. **LinkedIn Sync (Recommended)**: Connect your network directly through LinkedIn's secure authentication. Simply click "Connect with LinkedIn" and log in through LinkedIn's official login page. This is the fastest way to sync your network, and your data will be automatically synced once the connection is established.

2. **Recruiter Sync**: Opt for this if you prefer a hands-off approach. Ensure you're connected to at least one company recruiter on LinkedIn and that your profile visibility is set to public. This allows recruiters to sync your network without you needing to do anything else. Your network will be automatically updated over time, keeping the referral suggestions fresh and relevant.

3. **Manual Sync**: Fancy a bit more control? You can manually sync your network in two ways:
   - Install our Chrome Companion extension to enable Auto Sync functionality, keeping your network automatically up to date.
   - Download your LinkedIn connection data and upload it to Wintro. Keep in mind, this method requires manual updates in the future, which means more work for you to keep your referral suggestions up to date.

4. **Decline Participation**: Not feeling like sharing? You can choose not to participate, and your network won’t be synced or used for referrals.

### After Syncing Your Network
Once you choose your preferred sync option, it might take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours for your full network to sync (especially when our servers are buzzing with activity). But hang tight—you’ll start receiving notification about potential matches through Slack, Teams, Google Chat, or email as soon as they're ready.

Now, with your network connected, you're all set to review some exciting suggestions and see how you can help bring top talent into your company!
