In this section we'll explain how you can take an active role in shaping our company's future by reviewing and responding to candidate suggestions. It’s super easy and can also be quite rewarding!

### Understanding Your Suggestions
Once you’ve connected your network and we’ve synced it up, you’ll start receiving candidate suggestions right in your Wintro Intros tab. Each suggestion comes with detailed insights such as their compatibility score, main characteristics, and the reasoning behind the match. 

### Actions You Can Take
You have several actions at your disposal for each candidate suggestion:

- **Refer**: If you know the candidate and think they're a perfect fit, you can refer them directly. Just click on the candidate, fill out how you know them, why they are a great fit, and send them a personalized link to apply. Once you send the link, you’ll need to confirm the action. This helps us ensure that no candidate is referred more than once.

- **Recommend**: Maybe you don't know the candidate that well but their profile screams potential or you know they are a high hitter? Hit recommend! This lets us know they could be worth a closer look, even if you aren't able to vouch for them directly.

- **Not a Fit**: If you feel the candidate isn’t right for the role or our company, you can mark them as Not a Fit. You’ll be asked to specify whether your decision is just for this particular vacancy or all potential vacancies.

- **Don’t Know**: Connected but not really acquainted? It’s okay to choose Don’t Know. This helps maintain the integrity of your referrals and ensures we’re only moving forward with meaningful connections.

### What Happens Next?
- **After Referring**: Once you refer someone, that candidate will move to the Referred stage, and we’ll notify the recruitment team. Your action removes the candidate from others' suggestion lists to prevent duplicate referrals.

- **After Recommending**: Your recommendations move the candidate to a special Recommended stage where our recruiters take a closer look based on your input.

- **Not a Fit and Don’t Know**: These actions help fine-tune our algorithm and your future suggestions, ensuring more accurate matches as you continue to engage with Wintro.

### Keep Track of Your Actions
All the actions you take are tracked in your dashboard, allowing you to revisit and manage your referrals and recommendations anytime. Remember, successful referrals not only help our company but could also snag you a referral bonus!
