In this section we'll explain how you can take an active role in shaping our company's future by reviewing and responding to candidate suggestions. It’s super easy and can also be quite rewarding!

### Understanding Your Suggestions
Once you've connected your network and we've synced it up, you'll start receiving candidate suggestions right in your Wintro Intros tab. Each suggestion comes with detailed insights such as their compatibility score, main characteristics, and the reasoning behind the match.

For each suggestion, you'll see two main options: **Decline** or **Suggest Match**.

### Declining a Suggestion
If a candidate isn't the right fit, click **Decline** and let us know why:

- **Don't Know Them**: You're connected but not really acquainted. Selecting this ensures we won't suggest this person to you again in the future.
- **Not a Vacancy Fit**: They're not right for this specific role, but might be a good fit for other positions.
- **Not a Company Fit**: They're not a good match for your company culture or values overall.

Your feedback helps fine-tune our algorithm and improve future suggestions.

### Suggesting a Match
When you click **Suggest Match**, you'll choose between two options:

**Refer** - Contact them yourself
- You'll reach out to the candidate personally to tell them about the role
- Fill in how you know them and why they're a great fit
- Send them a personalized application link
- Best for people you know well and feel comfortable reaching out to
- Note: Referral bonuses may apply (check your company's referral program)

**Recommend** - Let the recruiter reach out
- You think they'd be a great fit, but prefer not to contact them directly
- Your recruiter will see your recommendation and can take it from there
- Perfect for connections you don't know that well, or when you'd rather stay out of the conversation
- Note: Recommendation bonuses may differ from referral bonuses (check your company's policy)

### What Happens Next?

**After Referring**: Once you refer someone, they'll appear in your **Referrals tab** where you can track their progress through the hiring process (if the candidate allows tracking). The recruitment team is notified, and the candidate is removed from others' suggestion lists to prevent duplicate referrals. Learn more on the next page: [Track your Referrals](/for-employees/track-your-referrals).

**After Recommending**: Your recommendation is sent to the recruitment team, who will review the candidate and decide whether to reach out. The candidate moves to a Recommended stage where recruiters can take action based on your input.

**After Declining**: Your feedback helps us improve future suggestions. If you selected "Don't Know Them," we won't suggest this person to you again.
