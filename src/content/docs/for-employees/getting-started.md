Hey there! Welcome to Wintro, where we make it super easy for you to help your company find great new hires—and maybe even earn some rewards along the way. Here’s a quick overview of what you can do:

* **Connect your Network**: First things first, connect your professional networks to Wintro. This allows our AI to start identifying potential candidates within your connections who might be a perfect fit for open roles.

* **Review Suggestions**: Take a look at the candidate suggestions generated by our AI. You'll review their profiles and decide if you think they're a good match for the company or specific vacancies.If you know someone who would be great for a role, you can refer them directly from the platform. Fill in a few details about how you know them and why they’re a fit, and send them a personal link to apply.

* **Track your Referrals**: Keep an eye on your actions within the platform, including who you have referred, recommended, or deemed not a fit. Note: Tracking what happens after a candidate is referred (such as interviews or hiring outcomes) is under development and will be available soon.

Getting started is easy, and your contributions can make a big difference!
