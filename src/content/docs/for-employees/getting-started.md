### How it works

* **Connect your Network**: Connect your professional networks to Wintro. Our AI will identify potential candidates within your connections who might be a perfect fit for open roles at your company.

* **Review Suggestions**: Review the candidate suggestions generated by our AI. You'll see their profiles and decide if they're a good match for specific vacancies. You have two options: **recommend** someone to your recruiter without contacting them directly, or **refer** them by filling in a few details about how you know them and why they're a fit, then sending them a personal application link.

* **Track your Referrals**: Monitor all your actions in one place, including who you've referred, recommended, or marked as not a fit. You'll be able to see the status of each referral as they progress through the hiring process.

Getting started is easy, and your referrals can make a real difference in building great teams!
