description: How to monitor your referral activities within Wintro.

Let's take a closer look at how you can keep track of all the referrals, recommendations, and feedback you've provided through Wintro. This feature helps you stay organized and informed about your contributions to your company's hiring efforts.

### Tracking Your Referrals
The **Referrals tab** is your dedicated space to monitor all candidates you've referred. Here's what you can see:

**Referral Progress Tracking**
- View the current status of each referral
- See if they've applied for the role
- Track if they're in the interviewing stage
- Know when they've been hired or if they're no longer being considered

**Managing Your Referrals**
Sometimes plans change—if a candidate you referred tells you they're no longer interested, you can help keep everyone informed:
1. Click the three dots (**...**) next to the referral
2. Select **"Cancel referral..."** from the dropdown
3. This lets recruiters know the candidate is no longer interested, which is valuable information for them

### Tracking Recommendations and Other Actions
Your other actions can be viewed in the **Intros tab** using filters:

- **Recommendations**: Filter to see all candidates you've recommended to recruiters (where you chose not to contact them directly)
- **Not a Fit**: View candidates you've declined and the reasons you provided
- **Reverting Actions**: Changed your mind? You can revert recommendations or "not a fit" decisions from the Intros tab

### Why It Matters
Keeping track of your referrals helps you manage your contributions and ensures you're recognized for your efforts. Every referral you make can significantly influence your team's composition and culture, and now you have full visibility into the impact of your recommendations.
