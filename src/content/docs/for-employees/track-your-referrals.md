description: How to monitor your referral activities within Wintro.
---

Let’s take a closer look at how you can keep track of all the referrals, recommendations, and feedback you’ve provided through Wintro. This feature helps you stay organized and informed about your contributions to your company's hiring efforts.

### Keeping Tabs on Your Actions
Within Wintro, you have a dedicated area to view all the actions you've taken on candidate suggestions. Here’s what you can track:

- **Referred Candidates**: See a list of all the candidates you have referred. This includes those you know personally and have recommended for specific roles through the referral link you sent.

- **Recommended Candidates**: Check out the candidates you've recommended based on their profiles, even if you don't know them personally. These are potential fits you've identified that our recruitment team will further evaluate.

- **Not a Fit**: View the candidates you've marked as Not a Fit. This section helps you keep track of whom you’ve considered unsuitable for current openings, providing valuable feedback to our recruitment algorithms.

### Future Developments
We’re always working to improve your experience and our platform's capabilities. Here’s what’s coming soon:

- **Post-Referral Tracking**: We're developing features that will allow you to track what happens after you refer a candidate. This includes updates on whether they've been contacted, if they’ve advanced in the hiring process, and the final outcome of their application. This way, you’ll have full visibility into the impact of your referrals!

### Why It Matters
Keeping track of your referrals not only helps you manage your contributions but also ensures you are recognized for your efforts, especially once our post-referral tracking is implemented. Every referral you make can significantly influence our team’s composition and culture, and we want you to see the ripple effects of your recommendations.
