description: How Wintro uses cognitive services
---

The Wintro platform relies on a range of internal and external services to analyze, process, and generate content. As for external services, Wintro leverages large language models, among others, from Azure’s Cognitive Services module (e.g. the GPT models) and Google Cloud Platform’s VertexAI (e.g. Gemini models).

_Note:_ For private company data, Wintro **exclusively** uses Azure services. This is to ensure that private data stays in the private cloud network.
