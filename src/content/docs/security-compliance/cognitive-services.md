---

At Wintro, we are committed to providing a secure and effective platform by integrating advanced cognitive capabilities through Azure's AI services. Specifically, we utilize the Azure OpenAI service, which powers our language processing features with the latest advancements in AI technology.

## Commitment to Data Privacy

- **Data Anonymization:** We prioritize your privacy by anonymizing all data before it is processed by Azure OpenAI. This process ensures that sensitive information is protected and that our services remain transparent and secure.

- **Secure Network Environment:** Although our operations leverage the robust Azure infrastructure, all interactions with Azure OpenAI occur within a virtual network that is meticulously configured to ensure maximum security.

### How We Secure Our Services

- **Virtual Network Configurations:** We use Azureâ€™s virtual networks to create a secure environment where data is processed. This network is tightly controlled to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that only anonymized data is handled.

- **Controlled Access:** Access to our Azure AI services is strictly regulated. We configure our network to block all unauthorized requests by default, only allowing data transactions that comply with our high security standards.

## Azure OpenAI at Wintro

The Azure OpenAI service we utilize is specifically chosen for its ability to handle complex language models efficiently. This technology enhances our platform's ability to process and analyze large volumes of text, providing insights and capabilities that are crucial for improving organizational hiring processes.

By employing Azure OpenAI within a secured and controlled environment, Wintro ensures that our application not only remains cutting-edge but also aligns with best practices for data handling and security without explicitly mentioning specific compliance frameworks.
