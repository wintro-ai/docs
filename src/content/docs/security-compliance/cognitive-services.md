description: How Wintro uses cognitive services
---

The Wintro platform relies on a range of internal and external services to analyze, process, and generate content. As for external services, Wintro leverages large language models from Azureâ€™s AI Services module (e.g. the GPT models from the OpenAI Service).
<!-- 
_Note:_ For private company data, Wintro **exclusively** uses Azure services. This is to ensure that private data stays in the private cloud network. -->
